# 👋 Welcome To My Portfolio

Hello how are you? My name is Miguel, I've been a FullStack developer for over 4 years, I've been programming since I was 11 years old (I'm currently 15 years old), I'm passionate about this area, and today I come to present to you the first version of my portfolio! I confess that it is a very simple portfolio, but I intend to add many new functions to it by the end of May this year so that it looks really cool!!

## 📚 About the project
My portfolio has sections to showcase my skills, completed projects and later I will add a section to have all my certificates.

## 🔍 Comments

This is my first portfolio, I will still improve many things.
